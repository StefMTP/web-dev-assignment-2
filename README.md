# web-dev-assignment-2

Express web app that fetches books from Penguin Random House API. Utilizes Mongo to store, edit and delete data on a personal book list.

## How to serve the page:

From the project's root directory, type "npm start". This serves the page locally on your computer on port 666.

Please, do not expose the ATLAS_URI string from the .env file on the internet. After all, the user 'examiner' of my mongo db will be deleted after the process of the project evaluation.
